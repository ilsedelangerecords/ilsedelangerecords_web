The same catalog number is used and even the matrix ore rim-number is the same whiths means al the albums are pressed with same master. On the back of the 2018 release states “this release 2013” like it was also pressed back then. There are also some differences, where the 2013 releases have high gloss sleeve and inner sleeve, the clear vinyl is made of matt paper. All so the barcode is different for the new release. The strangest difference is clearly the individual number on the two limited editions, on the Red vinyl it states as: No xxxxxx  and the 20th year clear vinyl edition now has: MOV xxxxxx. Music On Vinyl declared that the numburing and the 2013 release date was not an error.
