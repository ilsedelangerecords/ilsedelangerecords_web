│   └── [1000+ image files]
└── favicon.ico          # Site favicon
```

## 🚀 **Deployment Process**

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The deployment is automated via GitHub Actions:

1. **Content Validation**: Verifies all JSON files are present and valid
2. **Build Process**: Compiles React app with Vite bundler
3. **Asset Optimization**: Optimizes images and bundles code
4. **Static Generation**: Creates fully static website
5. **Deployment**: Uploads to production server via rsync

### Manual Deployment
If you need to deploy manually:

```bash
# Build the static website
pnpm run build

# Upload dist/ folder contents to your web server
# The website will work on any static hosting service
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting Content Loading**

### If Content Shows Zeros
The website loads content from JSON files. If you see "0 Albums, 0 Lyrics", check:

1. **Content Files**: Ensure `content/` directory exists in the deployed site
2. **File Paths**: Content should be accessible at `/content/albums.json`
3. **CORS Headers**: Some servers require proper CORS configuration for JSON files
4. **Cache**: Clear browser cache or try incognito mode

### Browser Console Debugging
Open browser developer tools (F12) and check the Console tab for errors:
- ✅ `Loaded albums: 44 items` = Working correctly
- ❌ `Error loading albums: 404` = Content files not accessible

### Server Configuration
For Apache servers, add to `.htaccess`:
```apache
# Allow JSON files to be served
<Files "*.json">
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
    Header set Content-Type "application/json"
</Files>
```

For Nginx servers, add to configuration:
```nginx
location ~* \\.json$ {
    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *;
    add_header Content-Type application/json;
}
```
